🔥 Essential Commands to Remember
📌 Activating Your Virtual Environment

Since you're using macOS (zsh), the command is:

source bin/activate
or if you’re outside the kivy_venv directory:

source kivy_venv/bin/activate
📌 Deactivating Your Virtual Environment

When you're done:

deactivate
📌 Checking If You're Inside a Virtual Environment

If you’re not sure whether the virtual environment is active, run:

which python
If it shows a path inside kivy_venv/bin/, you're inside the environment.

📌 Reinstalling Dependencies (If Needed)

pip install -r requirements.txt
📌 Running Your Kivy App

python main.py
📝 Where to Store This?
