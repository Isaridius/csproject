# csproject
this is so skidibi
we're doing a nutrition logger because myfitness pal is NOT skibidi
perhaps there's already my project made else where but better
but I do not care because imma do it my own way



I feel so GUILTY
Because this project is so MASSIVE
and overwhelming
I know Mr Park has given us all the resources needed to succeed
And I'm grateful for that
But I'll have y'all know I'm a lesser being


IT is currently
Jan 17 11:08 at the time I'm starting to write lines 17
I am royally screwed
And I can't complete all of this
I'm tired
I'm exhausted
I'm suffocating

And honestly I need to be liberated

I'll submit foodtracker.py just how it is
There's still problems
It's still in its infancy stages when it should be an adult right now

But I'm a bad parent
I don't know how to take care of children
Especially not myself

Forgive me
